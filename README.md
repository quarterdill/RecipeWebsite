# Dylan Xiao's Recipes

## Personal recipe website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. 

UPDATE: This was previously hosted on Heroku, but after they removed the free tier I chose to redesign it before deploying again it as this was created in first year, and I can make a lot of improvements to the code (and my recipes). Stay tuned!
